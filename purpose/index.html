        <h1>What is the purposes of Pyrex.me()?</h1>
        <div>
          <p>My initial idea with this project was simply a new Linux distro. I had taken a lot of inspiration from NixOS but really wanted to do something my own way. As I've continued to think about this and work on it, however, I have realized a few things:</p>
          <div>
            <li>
              <p>The community does not need another Linux distribution.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>I am not currently knowledgeable enough to build a distribution from scratch.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>The ammount of work and long-term maintenance required for a Linux distribution is not something I am capable of comitting to, currently.</p>
            </li>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h2>System and User OS layer seperation</h2>
            <div>
              <li>
                <p>NixOS takes the user configurability and puts it at the very forefront of the OS, making everything a singular config file for system rebuilding. This concept is the biggest part of NixOS that attracted me, as is the same, I'm sure, for most people.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>My aim here is to make a reproducible "framework" of sorts that is compatible with most/any Linux distribution system and give (at least some degree of) that reprocibility to the user.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>System files will likely need to be untouched or manually pathed, but the goal is for all packages and configs to be listed in one spot, an understandble language to configure them in and a way to transplant across builds.</p>
              </li>
            </div>
